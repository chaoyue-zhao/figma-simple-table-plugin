have in your original data and equally placed them in the width selected.

## Good-to-knows:

This plugin do not read .csv file. Please copy and paste your data in.

All the text are left aligned. The last column will be left aligned, taken considerations of the 
text length. In other words, the longest text will touch the right edge of the table. 

A line will be generated at the bottom of each row. If you select to indicate header is included 
in the first row. The first row will not have line under it. Lines generated have the same
colour as text.

## How to get in touch: 

This project starts because the team I worked at needed something like this so our wonderful PM 
team do not spend hours copying and pasting individual cells in. Because of this, the style of 
the table is designed for our needs. However, we want this to be available to the community. So 
if you have any feedback on how to make this plug in better, please shoot me an email:
